Detect obstacles on your robot buggy with this ultrasonic device

Using this ultrasonic detector is easy and gives accurate distance results up to about 3cm from the device.

In this video we've added it to the 2WD buggy we're slowly building (very cheap from the Gar East) and this gives it obstacle detection capabilities.

The sketches I used (first one without a library, second one with the NewPing library) are here in this GitHub)

If you really are that interested here's the location of that "wiring_private.h" file:

I couldn't find a Far Eastern version of the 3D printed one, so if you do find one please do post it in the comments under the video!
